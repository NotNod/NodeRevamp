# Nodes-Better-Items
A Minecraft Resource Pack for the NodeSMP. Not code but Curseforge is being cringe.
I'm new to making resource packs and don't want to wait for Curseforge to approve my project after waiting a month.
All the files will be under realeases. Just download it and copy it to your resourcepacks folder. There may be complicated release orders. For example, once I finish v1.3 all files ending in .5 (1.4.5, 1.5.5, 1.6.5) will not include the food/soda textures.
